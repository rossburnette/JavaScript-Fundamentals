JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.

It has a call stack, an event loop, a callback queue and other APIs.

a.k.a JavaScript is a single threaded programming language(single threaded runtime) 
=> single call stack
=> one thread == one call stack == one thing at a time (but not really)
