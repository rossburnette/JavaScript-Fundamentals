# JavaScript

A single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.
JavaScript has call stack, an event loop, a callback queue and other APIs.

 It is a high-level, interpreted programming language -  execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code).
